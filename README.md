This project is not affiliated with BeamMP or the BeamNG Drive mod. It is a separate project that aims to provide a feature-rich alternative to the original server implementation.

This project makes every effort to ensure that players are aware that this server is not an official implementation, and they should not seek support from the BeamMP team if they encounter any issues.
